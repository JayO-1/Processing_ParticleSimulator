# Particle Simulator
Particle simulator built using [Processing](https://processing.org/). Processing is a versatile programming language and graphics library built on Java, designed to empower artists and designers in the creation of digital media and interactive projects.

The phenomenon simulated is a grenade explosion, and the user has the option of varying various parameters such as:
- Number of particles
- Particle speed
- Particle lifetime
- Particle trails
- Gravity strength
- Wind strength
