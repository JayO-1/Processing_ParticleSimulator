# Particle Simulator
> Particle simulator built using Processing

Particle simulator built using [Processing](https://processing.org/). Processing is a versatile programming language and graphics library built on Java, designed to empower artists and designers in the creation of digital media and interactive projects.

The phenomenon simulated is a **grenade explosion**, and the user has the option of varying various parameters via a HUD such as:
- Number of particles
- Particle speed
- Particle lifetime
- Particle trails
- Gravity strength
- Wind strength

The FPS is displayed on screen to allow one to observe the effect on FPS of varying these parameters.

## Setup

1. Install Processing [here](https://processing.org/download)
2. Clone the repo
3. Create a new folder in Processing's sketchbook folder named **ParticleSimMain**. On Windows, this will be found under Documents/Processing by default
4. Copy all files ending in **.pde** to this folder
5. Run Processing
6. Go to File > Open and open **ParticleSimMain.pde**
7. Run the project using Processing's IDE
